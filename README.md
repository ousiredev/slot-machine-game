## 🧠 How It Works

1. The player starts with a chosen balance.  
2. You place a bet — if you don’t have enough, it’ll ask again.  
3. The reels spin and display random symbols (🍒, 🍋, 🔔, 💎, 🍀).  
4. If all three symbols match → you **win double your bet**.  
5. If not → you lose your bet.  
6. You can keep playing until you quit or your balance hits 0.
